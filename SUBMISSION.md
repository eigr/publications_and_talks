- Scaling and reliability.

# Submission

## Basic Information

### Title

> (It should be short, but descriptive)

- eigr.io â€“ A Serverless Runtime on the BEAM

### Abstract

> (Brief summary of your proposal, up to 512 characters.)

Serverless runtimes are often hidden in a cloud providers offering and exposed solely by their programming API and
deployment procedures. In this talk, we'll explore an open-source Serverless runtime built for the cloud and
on-premises, running on the BEAM with a polyglot programming model to build general purpose applications.

### Additional notes on the abstract

> (Not enough space to express your idea? This part will not be published in the programme app, but the committee will see it when discussing your submission.)

Building general purpose applications using multiple languages and having a story how to handle state was our main
motivation to explore the space of a Serverless runtime to be built. An open source project (currently hibernating)
based on Akka with a promising technical concept let us to build that runtime. We think the BEAM, OTP and Elixir/Erlang
are a perfect match for that to build on it. With this talk, we combine herein the world of the BEAM with
cloud-technology like a gRPC-based protocol, Kubernetes and as well a polyglot programming model with languages like Go,
JavaScript, JVM-languages, Python and many more supported.

Marcel Lanz is a System and Software Architect working at proCentric AG. At heart, he is an engineer and in general
curious how things work. He has been working professionally for over 20 years in different fields like embedded
operating systems design and realtime-systems as well as with enterprise systems in healthcare, insurance and fintech
industries. When he is not exploring all things Go, Erlang and Serverless, Marcel enjoys time with his family, his

Adriano Santos, sleipnir@bsd.com.br

#### Talk objective(s)

> (What does the talk aim to achieve?)

In this talk, we'll present how the BEAM and OTP is an ideal fit to build a Serverless runtime on top of. After a short
introduction about Serverless and a polyglot programming model, we'll present the open-source project at eigr.io where
we implemented the core of our runtime in Elixir/OTP. Beside presenting the eigr.io project, we aim to inspire others to
explore the world of Serverless and help to build the Serverless runtime at eigr.io
