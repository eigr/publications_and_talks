# 1. Serverless on the BEAM â€“ with polyglot language support for everyone

- develop general purpose applications
- polyglot
    - state management
        - state models (None, EventSourcing, CRUD, CRDTs, ...)
        - inversion of state

> marcel: I think we can explain that the technical basis for such a serverless runtime (can we call it runtime?) and its tech stack, does not mean that we would expect an Elixir/Erlang OTP Developer would choose for to develop distributed applications. But for anyone who likes to develop in Python, JS or any supported language, she can. In this regard, the benefits of the OTP/BEAM runtime helps to enable an environment where the advantages of "serverless" and cloud native can help to be productive.

# 2. The eigr.io project

> marcel: Idea is to give context. How it started; I think Jonas Talk at Kubecon was foundational. Then CLoudstate came along with an idea how to implement. There, the CS-Protocol is the most important asset I think. As we state, we build eigr/massa as a Cloudstate compatible proxy. Said, its compatible with Cloudstate, that does not mean it can't do its own stuff, with an enganced protocol. I seriously doubt LB will bring Cloudsdtate on par with Akkaserverless; too much has changed. But, we mihght be surprised.

> marcel: there is the narrative why we would build a serverless stack, where, serverless today seems to be a product. As LB found out, they can't make a business out of having Cloudstate as an open source project, but have to provide the Serverless experience as a product. For me, having the serverless experience to build "general purpose applications" should be possible, without being locked to a vendor. If my IT can manage kubernetes workload, eigr-serverless, or however we call that, would be on a private or public cloud, I'd control the thing in its entirety. Depending who you ask for, but what I see in my work experience, no serious traditional project would use a serverless product like the one from Lightbend to build their traditional general purpose application like a pension services application or any I can think of. So in this regards our project is an implementation of the ideas Cloudstate established, than can be used without sticking to a vendor.

# The Protocol

- based on Cloudstate

> marcel: I'd explain the high level stuff. Message-In, Message-Out, , the proxy, gRPC, Discovery, Entity-Models, language supports. I'm hesistated to use the term SDK, as AkkaServerless does, we're not a product. But we'll see, dapr.io also has SDKs I think.

# On the BEAM

- why

> marcel: here comes why the BEAM and OTP is a perfect fit for our project. I mean, the OTP/BEAM running the eigr/massa proxy is like a control-plane of a large telephone switch, where user-functions and the messages that go in and out are the data-plane the proxy manages. Sure, the BEAM might be "slow"? for stuff like protocol some will say, we'll see if that is the case.
