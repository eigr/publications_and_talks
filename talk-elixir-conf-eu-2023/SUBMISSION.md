The Programme Committee will deliberate on the submissions in December and we aim to get back to you with the decision by 5 Jan 2023.

## Description

Spawn is an initiative to define the next generation of polyglot Serverless applications by adding a concept, model and implementation with regard to state. Anyone who's ever built a cloud application, a distributed system, knows that state is actually the hardest part to deal with, while serverless kind of ignores that â€“ we bring state to the heart of everything.
Spawn's main goal is to remove the complexity in developing microservices, providing simple and intuitive APIs based on a Actor Model. This leaves the developer to focus on developing the business domain while the platform deals with the complexities and infrastructure needed to support the scalable, resilient, distributed, and event-driven architecture that microservices-driven systems requires.
Spawn is based on the sidecar proxy pattern to provide a polyglot Actor Model framework and platform. Spawn's technology stack, built on the BEAM VM and OTP, provides support for different languages from its native Actor model.

## Session format 

In-person

## Talk objective(s) 

Demonstrate that we can design multi-language, distributed, resilient, message-driven systems using BEAM technology and only focusing on the business domain. Not only taking the Erlang community one step further, but making BEAM the foundation for the next wave of Serverless services for the Cloud and Edge 

## Target audience

For all audiences. But mainly for those who need speed in building systems without neglecting the maintainability, elasticity and resilience of these systems 

## Level

Intermediate

## Which three words would best sum up your talk?

#eigr #spawn #serverless #statefulServerless 

## Question would you like to be ask during the Q&A 

how Spawn compares to other Serverless service offerings? 

## Notes and comments

I intend to tell a little of the history of the Stateful Serverless movement from the famous The Berkeley Serverless Overview paper to how we came to the conclusion that BEAM was the perfect technology to build this type of system.
