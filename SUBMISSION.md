# Submission

## Basic Information

### Title

> (It should be short, but descriptive)

- eigr.io – Towards a Serveless Runtime on the BEAM

### Abstract

> (Brief summary of your proposal, up to 512 characters.)

Serverless runtimes are often hidden with a cloud provider offering, exposed solely by their API and deployment
procedures. We explore an open-source serverless runtime built for on-premise and the cloud running on the BEAM, with a
polyglot programming model to build general purpose applications.

### Additional notes on the abstract

> (Not enough space to express your idea? This part will not be published in the programme app, but the committee will see it when discussing your submission.)

Building general purpose applications using multiple languages and also having a story how to handle state was our main
motivation to explore the space of a serverless runtime to be built as an open source project. An abandoned open source
project based on an Actor based framework (Akka Cluster) with a promising technical concept, let us to build that
runtime. And we think the BEAM and OTP is a perfect match.

#### Talk objective(s)

> (What does the talk aim to achieve?)

We present how the BEAM and OTP is an ideal fit to build a serverless runtime on top off. Topics are:

- Introduce the concept of polyglot serverless
- Handling state in Serverless FaaS
- The Cloudstate Protocol based on gRPC
- eigr/massa – a Cloudstate proxy implementation in Elixir on the BEAM
- Demo FaaS, Action Protocol

Beside presenting the eigr project, we aim to invite others to explore the project and help us to build the
eigr/serverless runtime.

#### Target audience

> (Who would this talk appeal to?)

Beginner, Intermediate; individuals interested in serverless, distributed state management and gRPC protocols.

#### Your talk is mostly suitable to?

- Beginners
- Intermediate users
